# 427

Clone of Employee #427's monitor from video game [The Stanley Parable](https://www.stanleyparable.com/) by Galactic Cafe.

> Employee # 427â€™s job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what employee 427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy.
